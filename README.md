#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a way of applying engineering principles to design, develop,test, and maintain software. This process is systematic and comprehensive and it covers the entire development life cycle of the software. This ensures the software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and that it meets the requirement it is specified concerning.
Software Engineering plays important roles in the technology industry like banking, by creating solutions that makes financial transactions a breeze while ensuring that those transactions are securely protected from intrusions and breaches. More so, software engineering has helped and is helping in creating solutions in healthcare, agriculture, hospitality management, manufacturing and quality management systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Software Engineering has come a long way from it's early days of trial and errors to the development of methodologies that are rigidly structured and then the shift to more iterative processes. These evolutions has made software engineering what it is today; robust and dynamic, and capable of meeting the ever changing demands of the technology industry.
#Milestone 1: Software Engineering is born (1968): This term "Software Engineering" as we know it was first introduced during NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 to address the "software crisis" at the time. This signified the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline and a need for structure to manage the execution of the complexities in the projects.
#Milestone 2: The Waterfall Model (1970): This model follows a linear and sequential flow where one phase has to be completed before the next phase begins. It was introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970. It was revolutionary at the time in providing clear structure and process for the software development cycle. However, it was later criticized for it's rigidity and lack of flexibility.
#Milestone 3: Agile Methodologies (2001): This emerged as a response to the rigidity of the other traditional models like the previous mentioned; Waterfall Model. Agile promotes flexibility with iterative process where software is built incrementally with feedbacks from stakeholders. This method emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements Analysis: Here, the specific needs of the software development are gathered and documented including user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: From the requirements, the software's architecture and designs are created. The designs include user interface, system design, database design, etc.
3. Implementation: The actual code is written according to the design requirements and specifications.
4. Testing: Various tests are conducted thoroughly to ensure the software works as intended and meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: The software is now released to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: The software is monitored, updated and enhanced as needed by providing ongoing support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall Methodology is characterised by:
Linear and sequential approach with distinct phases - Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Like a water falls downwards, each phase must be completed before the next. No overlap.
Predictability since all the requirements are predefined, timelines, resources needs, and costs are easier to predict.
Documentation: The methodology places high demand on documentations with detailed documentation created and maintained throughout the project for future reference and maintenance.
Flexibility limitations: It is difficult and costly to implement changes once development has left the requirements phase.
WHEN TO USE WATERFALL METHODOLOGY
Government Projects: Government projects are usually grand and large scale and often requires a sequential order of execution, detailed documentation, fixed prices, and clear deliverables.
Waterfall rigid structure is very much suited for this.

2. Agile Methodology is characterised by:
Iterative and incremental approach called sprints where the software is developed incrementally and delivered.
Flexibility and Adaptability nature of Agile allows changes to be made at any point in the project.
Collaboration and Communication in Agile ensures everyone is aligned and that issues are sorted out quickly.
Less focus on documentation: While documentation is still important in Agile, Agile however, prioritises working software over comprehensive documentation.
WHEN TO USE AGILE METHODOLOGY
Software Startups: Because of the high dynamic working environment of Startups, Agile is suitable here since requirements can change rapidly based on market feedback. Agile's flexibility allows teams to pivot quickly and adapt to the new information.
   

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software is of high quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS play crucial role in the software development process. IDEs provides an environment that integrates all the tools a developer needs by enhancing productivity and code quality.
VCS ensures that developers can collaborate effectively, maintain a history of changes called commits, and protect their work from loss.
IDEs examples include: Visual Studio by Microsoft, Eclipse, PyCharm by JetBrains, and IntelliJ IDEA etc.
VCS examples include: Git with platforms like GitLab, GitHub, etc., Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software Engineers face some common challenges. It's interesting to note that some of these challenges comes from the SDLC. They include: 
Changing requirements may lead to scope creep and project delays.
Tight deadlines can put pressure to meet schedule of the software product with consequences of compromised software quality.
Technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
HOW TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES
Effective communication ensures goals are aligned and issues are sorted out.
Agile Methodology implementation that allows for flexibility of software development cycle.
Tasks prioritisation and regular reassessment of project goals, and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is a process that involves crafting questions, commands, or inputs in a way that maximises a robot's or AI's ability to produce with accuracy, relevant, and useful outputs or answers.
IMPORTANCE OF PROMPT ENGINEERING IN INTERACTING WITH AI MODELS
Improvement in AI response quality since well crafted prompts guides the model in generating accurate and appropriate responses to the questions inputted.
Details Control: Prompt Engineering gives the user the power to control the details and even scope of the AI's responses by making the command clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what the user needs.
Manages Ambiguity: Poorly phrased or ambiguous choice of words can lead to incorrect answers. To craft effective prompts, be clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Using the above job description, and my experience, create a cover letter for me.
Clear Prompt: Using the above job description, and my experience, craft a well detailed cover letter emphasizing on my core competencies as it matches the job description. Keep it under 300 words.
The second prompt is more effective because I specifically instructed the AI on what to focus on based on the information I gave it earlier about my experience and job description, and also how I want it to perform the instructions by being specific down to the word count.
